<h1> Best Movies Eunice Watched</h1>
<h2> My favorite movies.</h2>
<hr />
<h3> Les Crocodiles du Botswana</h3>
<p> This is my favorite French movie, because it is very funny.</p>
<h3> Think like a Man</h3>
<p> I like this movie because it is also funny, but it is also very insightful to see how different men and women minds are.</p>
<h3> Home Alone</h3>
<p> This is the best childhood movie I watched and I love the memories I have with my siblings watching it.</p>
<h4>Fun fact I don't like watching movies, but I love reading books.</h4>
<p> 
    I might even try <br>
    Reading a <br>
    Poem<br>
